<section data-name="Description">

<p>The <b>fragments</b> dump format lists the fragment references made by the
program.</p>

<p>A fragment is a chunk of text that documents some particular element.
Internally, fragments are represented by a collection of files. A fragment
reference is a combination of a file path, which drills into the file tree, and
a "section" path, which drills into the sections of the referred file.</p>

<p>The following top-level directories are defined:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Libraries</b>: Descriptions of items within libraries.</li>
<li><b>Types</b>: Descriptions of data types.</li>
<li><b>Commands</b>: Descriptions of sub-commands.</li>
<li><b>DumpFormats</b>: Descriptions of dump formats (like this one).</li>
<li><b>Flags</b>: Descriptions of flags that apply to multi sub-commands.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that only fragments referred to by the program are listed. For a
complete list of all fragments, use the following command:</p>

<pre><code>rbxmk doc --recursive</code></pre>
