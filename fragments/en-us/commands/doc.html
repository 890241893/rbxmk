<section data-name="Description">

<p>The <b>doc</b> command displays documentation for a given API or topic.</p>

<p>Topics are stored in a tree, where each topic may have sub-topics. A
"reference", similar to a file path, can refer to a topic, or a section within a
topic. The presence of a <code>:</code> separator causes the <i>reference</i> to
begin drilling into the sections of the topic to the left of the separator. The
topic portion of a reference is case-insensitive, while the section portion is
case-sensitive. For example,</p>

<pre><code>rbxmk doc types/Instance:Methods/FindFirstChild</code></pre>

<p>This reference will start at the top-level "types" topic, then drill into the
"Instance" sub-topic, then drill into the "Method" section, then the
"FindFirstChild" sub-section. The doc command will then display the content of
this sub-section only.</p>

<p>If the referred topic has no content, but has sub-topics, then these
sub-topics are listed instead (see --list). If no reference is specified, then
all top-level topics are listed.</p>

<p>The following top-level topics are available:
{{Topics}}</p>

<section data-name="Flags">

<section data-name="list">

<p>Returns a list of sub-topics and sub-sections for the given reference. If no
reference is specified, then all top-level topics are listed.</p>

<p>The top-level sections of a topic will be prefixed with ":". Sub-topics and
sub-sections of sections will be prefixed with "/". That is, the whole name of a
listed item, including the prefix, can be appended to the current reference to
query that item.</p>
