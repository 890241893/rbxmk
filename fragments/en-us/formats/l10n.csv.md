# Summary
Encodes localization data.

# Description
The **l10n.csv** format decodes comma-separated localization data into a
LocalizationTable instance, where the data is assigned to the Contents property.

Direction | Type                 | Description
----------|----------------------|------------
Decode    | [Instance][Instance] | A LocalizationTable with a Contents property.
Encode    | Stringable           | Any string-like value.

Decoded data is a string in JSON format with the following structure:

	[
		{
			"key":      "string",
			"context":  "string",
			"examples": "string",
			"source":   "string",
			"values": {
				"locale": "string",
				...
			},
		},
		...
	]

Well-formed data has certain constraints, which are described in the
[LocalizationTable
page](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/LocalizationTable)
of the DevHub. rbxmk applies these same constraints when encoding and decoding.
To avoid data loss, they are applied more strictly. Rather than discarding data,
any conflict that arises will throw an error that describes the conflict in
detail.

This format has no options.
