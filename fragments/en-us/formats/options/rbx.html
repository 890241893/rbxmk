<section data-name="Desc">

<p>Sets the descriptor to be used when encoding or decoding. If
<code>false</code>, then no descriptor is used. Otherwise, the descriptor of the
root instance is used <b>with all descendants</b>, falling back to <a
href="api:rbxmk.globalDesc">globalDesc</a>.</p>

</section>

<section data-name="DescMode">

<p>Determines how deviations from the descriptor are handled.
<code>"NonStrict"</code> causes deviations to be ignored. <code>"Strict"</code>
causes an error to be thrown for the first deviation. <code>"Preserve"</code>
tries to retain as much information as possible, usually by behaving as if no
descriptor is set.</p>
