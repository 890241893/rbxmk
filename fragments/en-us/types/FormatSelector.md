# Summary
Selects a format with an optional configuration.

# Description
The **FormatSelector** type selects a [format](formats.md), and optionally
configures the format.

If a table, then the Format field indicates the name of the format to use, and
remaining fields are options that configure the format, which depend on the
format specified. All such fields are optional.

If a string, it is the name of the format to use, and specifies no options.
